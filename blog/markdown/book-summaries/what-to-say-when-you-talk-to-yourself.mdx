#### My book summaries contain highlights from the book if I have read from Kindle.

* > And if we can, or should, control our lives, what goes wrong? What holds us back? If we truly would like to do better, be the way we really would like to be, and be happier and more successful every day in every area of living, what is the wall that stands in our way?”

* > I saw that even the best-selling success solutions were able to _create lasting changes_ in only a handful of the tens of thousands of people who tried them. They would work for a time, and then the average individual would revert to his old ways. After the first excitement of the brand-new self-belief wore off, the dreams soon gave way to the realities of everyday living.

* > It became obvious to me after all my research that within the information on how to lead a better life, how to find more happiness and personal fulfillment, _something vital_ was missing. It was something so essential, so important to the whole process of achieving success that, without it, the solutions wouldn’t work—at least, not for any length of time.

* > After you examine the philosophies, the theories, and the practiced methods of influencing human behavior, you’ll find, as I did, that it gets down to the simplicity of one small but powerful fact: **_You will become what you think about most; your success or failure in anything, large or small, will depend on your programming––what you accept from others, and what you say when you talk to yourself._**
