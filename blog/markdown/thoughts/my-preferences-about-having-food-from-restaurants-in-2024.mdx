Restaurants offer a convenient option for meals, but my approach to dining out or ordering in is selective and infrequent.

There are two main scenarios where I might consider restaurant food, but both are rare and depend on specific factors:

## Option 1: Ordering via Apps

### When Do I Order?

Ordering through apps like Swiggy or Zomato is a last resort for me. Over the last five years, I've noticed rising costs (thanks, inflation) and declining quality or quantity (hello, shrinkflation). With added expenses like packaging costs, GST, and delivery fees, the value just isn't there for me.

Often, the portion size or quality of one dish isn't sufficient, forcing me to order a second item—sometimes more than I actually need. So, I only opt for this when:

- I'm pressed for time.
- My cook isn't available to prepare fresh food at home.

Otherwise, the return on investment (RoI) just doesn't justify the choice to order in.

## Option 2: Dining Out at Restaurants

### When Do I Go to a Restaurant?

Going to a restaurant is more of a social activity and is usually planned with family or friends. It's not something I do frequently—perhaps a few times each quarter. The decision is typically driven by:

- Recommendations or searches on Zomato.
- Instagram Reels that I've saved or that have been shared with me by my wife, friends, etc.

For me, dining out is about enjoying good food in the company of others, making the experience more about connection than convenience.

**My preference** is **eating at home**, whether the meal is cooked by my cook, myself, or my wife. This allows me to **control what ingredients are added** and the **cost**, and over time, it's more **aligned with** the **health and fitness goals** of myself and my family.
