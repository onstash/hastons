## Chapter 1: Looking for a Better Way

We all dream big, aiming for a life filled with success, happiness, and fulfillment.

**But how often do we find ourselves stuck, unable to reach those dreams?**

The answer lies in understanding the powerful connection between our thoughts and reality. We are the product of our thoughts—everything we think, believe, and focus on shapes our lives. So, if something's holding us back, it's likely our own mental barriers.

**The question is: how do we overcome them?**

## Chapter 2: The "Answers"

**Despite countless success strategies out there, most fail to create lasting change.**

Why?

Because while they may inspire temporary motivation, our old habits and negative self-talk eventually pull us back. The key insight is simple yet profound: **_we become what we think about most_**.

Our success or failure hinges on the mental programming we've absorbed over the years, from others and from ourselves.

The brain, our powerful personal computer, simply believes what it's told most often. Whether positive or negative, those repeated thoughts shape our reality. If we've been feeding our minds with negativity—often unintentionally—we're wiring our brains to fail.

This negative programming comes from all around us: parents, siblings, teachers, colleagues, the media. It's been layered into our minds, shaping our self-image and limiting our potential. The good news? This programming isn't permanent. We can rewire our brains, replacing negative thoughts with empowering ones. It takes effort, but by consistently feeding our minds with positive, goal-oriented self-talk, we can break down those invisible walls of doubt and unlock our unlimited potential.

## Chapter 3: Creating Positive Change That Lasts

In today's world, where rapid change is the norm, it's easy to get excited about new ideas or strategies for personal growth.
But how do we ensure that these changes stick?

The answer lies in understanding and leveraging the **brain's remarkable ability to rewire itself**—a concept known as **neuroplasticity**. Here are the three crucial ingredients to create lasting, positive change:

1. **Wiring New Ideas into Your Brain**: For any new idea or positive change to become permanent, it must be physically wired into your brain. This isn't just about thinking differently for a few days or weeks; it's about embedding these new thoughts into your brain's neural networks. If you don't, even the best ideas will only have a temporary effect.

2. **Understanding the Wiring Process**: To create lasting change, you need to understand how your brain gets wired. Every thought, every word you repeat to yourself, plays a role in this process. The more you reinforce a thought, the stronger the neural connections become, turning those thoughts into automatic habits.

3. **Using a New Programming Vocabulary**: Change begins in the mind, and to reprogram your mind, you need a new set of instructions—specific words and phrases that replace old, negative programming. This new vocabulary should be designed to speak directly to both your conscious and subconscious mind, guiding them towards positive, productive outcomes. The key is consistency and precision in the language you use when talking to yourself.

## Chapter 8: The Self-Management Sequence

In the journey towards personal and professional success, our actions often determine the outcome.

_**However**_, the process leading to those actions is far more intricate than it seems.

In Chapter 8 of "What to Say When You Talk to Yourself," Dr. Shad Helmstetter introduces us to the Self-Management Sequence, a powerful framework that explains how our behaviors are shaped and how we can take control of our success or failure. Let's break down the five essential steps:

1. **Behavior**
   Behavior is the most direct factor in determining our success or failure. It's what we do—or don't do—that shapes our outcomes. Consistently taking the right actions leads to positive results, while wrong actions yield poor outcomes. But if we know the right things to do, why don't we always do them? The answer lies deeper in our psyche.

2. **Feelings**
   Every action we take is filtered through our feelings. If we feel positive about something, we're more likely to take positive actions towards it. Our feelings, whether joy, fear, or indifference, heavily influence how we behave in various aspects of our lives—be it our work, relationships, or health.

3. **Attitudes**
   Our feelings are rooted in our attitudes—the perspectives from which we view the world. Our attitudes are not random; they shape how we feel about everything and thus determine our behaviors. A positive attitude can lead to positive feelings and actions, while a negative attitude does the opposite.

4. **Beliefs**
   Our attitudes are shaped by our beliefs. What we believe about ourselves, others, and the world around us determines our attitudes. Beliefs are powerful; they don't even need to be true to influence us. Our mind accepts and acts upon what we believe, regardless of whether it's based on reality.

5. **Programming**
   At the root of it all is programming. From the moment we are born, we are programmed by our environment—parents, teachers, society—to believe certain things. This programming shapes our beliefs, which in turn create our attitudes, feelings, and ultimately, our behaviors. Whether our programming is accurate or not, it heavily influences the trajectory of our lives.

The Sequence in Summary:

- **Programming** creates **beliefs**.
- **Beliefs** create **attitudes**.
- **Attitudes** create **feelings**.
- **Feelings** determine **actions**.
- **Actions** create **results**.

## Chapter 9: The Five Levels of Self-Talk

Self-talk is a method to override our past negative programming by replacing it with conscious, positive new directions. It allows us to live our lives with active intent rather than by passive acceptance.

### Level 1 Self-Talk: The Level of Negative Acceptance ("I can't...")

Level 1 represents **Negative Acceptance**—the self-talk where we say something negative about ourselves and accept it as true. This is the most frequently used and damaging form of self-talk.

#### Key Characteristics:

- **Phrases like**: "I can't...," "If only I could...," "I wish I could..."
- **Examples**: "I just don't have the energy I used to," "I could never do that," "I just can't seem to lose weight."

#### **Impact:**

Level 1 self-talk works against us by creating self-doubt, cluttering our minds, and crippling our best intentions. It leads us to accept less than we are capable of, turning self-assurance into self-doubt and complacency.

### Level 2 Self-Talk: The Level of Recognition—and Need to Change ("I need to… I should...")

Level 2 self-talk is deceptive. It seems helpful because it recognizes the need to change but ultimately works against us by creating guilt and disappointment without offering a solution.

#### Key Characteristics:

- **Phrases like**: "I need to...," "I ought to...," "I should..."
- **Example**: "I should start exercising more."

#### **Impact:**

While it acknowledges a problem, Level 2 self-talk creates no actionable plan, leading to feelings of inadequacy and reinforcing the idea that change is needed but not achievable.

### Level 3 Self-Talk: The Level of Decision to Change ("I never...I no longer…")

Level 3 self-talk marks a turning point. It's the first level that works for you by acknowledging the need for change and making a decisive, present-tense statement as though the change has already occurred.

#### Key Characteristics:

- **Phrases like**: "I never...," "I no longer..."
- **Examples**: "I never procrastinate," "I no longer overeat."

#### **Impact:**

By rephrasing old negative thoughts into positive affirmations, Level 3 self-talk helps your subconscious mind embrace change and encourages action toward improvement.

### Level 4 Self-Talk: The Level of the Better You ("I am")

Level 4 self-talk is the most effective form. It involves creating a vivid picture of the person you want to be and presenting it to your subconscious as your new reality.

#### Key Characteristics:

- **Phrases like**: "I am..."
- **Examples**: "I am confident," "I am healthy and strong."

#### **Impact:**

Level 4 self-talk empowers you by challenging fears and reinforcing self-belief. It reprograms your mind to work towards the best version of yourself, making success and positive change attainable.

### Level 5 Self-Talk: The Level of Universal Affirmation ("It is…")

Level 5 self-talk is the use of "affirmations."

This form of spiritual affirmation is characterized by the words, "It is..." such as, "I am one with the universe, and it is one with me. I am of it, within it, and exist as a shining spark of light in a firmament of divine goodness."

To un-confuse the reader, here are the author's definitions:

- **Affirmation** - A usually spiritually-oriented phrase, often general in nature, which affirms an overriding consciousness of unity and well-being.
- **Self-Talk** - Specific statements of self-direction designed to wire new neural pathways into the brain.
