## Swiggy

When I first heard about _Swiggy_ from my boss, _Gokul Nath Sridhar_, I thought it wouldn’t be different from the popular _food-delivery startups_ like _Foodpanda_, _Tinyowl_ or a standalone app like _Zomato Order_. They stand out because the control the logistics, amazing UX in their mobile and web apps and the over-the-top consistent delivery experience, which is the most important thing for a food-delivery startup.

## RedBus

Limited bus services have tracking enabled in them so you can know where they’re before you board. This was especially useful for me when I left for Chennai from Bengaluru on Christmas eve considering the fact that ‘traffic jam’ is a usual phenomenon. Periodic text messages about the location of the bus after it crossed bus stops (4 stops before your boarding point) with the ETA mentioned and apology if it is delayed. Best of them is the phone call to inform that the next stop for the bus is your boarding point.

## Pocket

The introduction of recommending articles and a separate recommendation feed in which you can even follow people, is a good (albeit expected) product update!

## Tenreads

To be honest, the product has come a long way in the course of the whole year, with the introduction of local editions, to the unveiling of mobile apps (iOS and Android), to _Project Octopus_ and the latest UI changes in our web app. Some users have told us that they use our product everyday and that’s what we strive for (in a bigger scale). We still have a long way to go!
