> Comparison is the thief of joy.

We all have heard this saying from our parents, friends, and even our therapists.

Yet, I don't think that's the full meaning of the quote.

Let me explain why.

## The Thief of Joy

When you compare yourself with someone who is:

1. Your close/best/long lost friend with whom you're catching up after a while
2. That school/college mate on Instagram, LinkedIn, or any other social media platform

Like a strava post about running 5km.

You're basically taking your entire being and comparing to someone else's highlight reel.

But not the behind the scenes.

And no wonder you feel like 💩.

You somehow reactivate the subscription to "Imposter Syndrome".

## The Police of Misery

Let's say you and your friend, regularly meet up, and go for walks.

You both use strava to track your walks.

You somehow don't reactivate the subscription to "Imposter Syndrome".

How? Why?

Because you both are in the "journey" together. Meaning you have a sneak peek into their behind the scenes.

## The Police of Joy (or) The Thief of Misery?

What if we combine both the aspects:

1. Take who you were yesterday
2. Take who you are today
3. Compare & see the difference
4. Treat yourself with kindness & no judgement like you do with your best friend
5. Take your Vitamin 'G' (Gratitude)
6. Keep progressing and hence winning
7. Even if you feel you're not progressing, you're still aware and in the arena and hence that's progressing
