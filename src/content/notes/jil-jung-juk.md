Listening to _Casanova_ from the movie’s jukebox at 0130 hrs on a Saturday morning, I try to pen down my interpretations of the wicked movie [_Jil Jung Juk_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jil_Jung_Juk)_._

### Spoilers ahead (duh…) #CinemaSinsStyle

The film is revolves around _Nan_**_jil_** _Shivaji_, **_Jung_**_ulingam_ and _Jaguar_ **_Jak_**_an._ **_Jil_** specializes himself in talking his way through obstacles while **_Jung_** is a time-master of sorts. **_Jak_,** as his full name _Jaguar Jakan_ might have probably suggested, is a master driver minus a driver’s license. All of them are caught in between three gangs in a not-so-distant future (the year is 2020).

My understanding is that these people are the three traits a human in the 21st century needs to thrive - the skills needed to manage people, time and drive yourself to the future rather than the future randomly knocking on your door , catching you off guard thereby. The obstacles they face are analogical to the obstacles we all face in our lives as such. Sometimes you just need to rationally plan out things like **_Jil_** instead of giving in to your emotions like **_Jung_** or sometimes **_Jak_**.

> Basically ‘**shit happens’ in life. You just have to deal with it.**

Also did any of you notice the **‘**anticipating the future’ moments from the _Guy Ritchie’s_ **_Sherlock_** _movies?_
