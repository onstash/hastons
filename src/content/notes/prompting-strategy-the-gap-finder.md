## The Core Idea

The Gap Finder method is a specific prompting strategy designed to identify blind spots in your knowledge, logic, and reasoning.

## How the Method Works

The core of this method involves explicitly asking the AI to critique your understanding based on the information it has gathered about you during your interactions. The source suggests utilizing a prompt such as: "Based on whatever you know about me through our chats, tell me what are the gaps in my knowledge, what don't I know, what am I missing, what are the gaps in my reasoning".

Or, you can use [this link (via PromptBuilder)](https://prompt-builder-ten-xi.vercel.app/prompts/expert-of-my-chat-contexts-based-on-whatever-yo-3ef89e) to use the prompt directly.

To use this effectively, you must first provide the AI with "puzzle pieces"—information about your current worldview or specific knowledge on a topic. Once the AI has this context, it can evaluate your inputs against its broader database to identify what is missing.

## Potential Upsides

### Psychological Safety

Having a human point out your weaknesses might make you feel bad or defensive. However, interacting with an AI creates a "safe space" where you can receive criticism without judgment, allowing you to focus on strengthening your reasoning rather than protecting your ego.

### Continuous Improvement

By running this prompt regularly (e.g., every week), you can receive ongoing feedback on various activities, such as content creation, management, or technical understanding, effectively using the AI to make you "stronger" by targeting specific weaknesses,.

### What's Next?

Beyond just identifying current weaknesses, this method can be extended to guide future learning. You can ask the AI, "Based on what you know about me, what should I learn next?"
