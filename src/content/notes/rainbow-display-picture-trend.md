The rainbow display-picture "trend" has brought out the dark passengers of people.

On one side, we have people who support this historic judgement by the United States’ Supreme Court regarding legalizing same-sex marriages. Facebook decided to help people to pledge their support by bringing out the "celebratewithpride" rainbow display picture themer (honestly I didn’t know what else to call it).

On the other side, we have people "critizing" people who support the aforementioned judgement by solving the "caste-issue" before moving towards "same-sex marriages being legalized". They sound like commies.

And in a galaxy far far away, there are pseudo intellects on Quora (you know whom in talking about) who criticize people who changed their display picture into a rainbow themed one because it "seemed cool and trendy" for them. It is sad.

Yes. Inter-caste marriages are a big taboos but they’re not illegal. On the other hand, same-sex marriages are not legal and punishable by law. The caste issue is a problem in the system that needs to be fixed from in the inside but the same-sex issue is a problem in the system that needs to be fixed from the outside as well as the inside.
