MRW when I come back to work the next day / on Monday / after the weekend / after a vacation. Pick your poison.

This is a very short post containing 2 sections: What is this “Productivity Hack” (+credits to the Banger Tweet), Action Steps aka “How to”.

## What is this “Productivity Hack”?

‘Continue Game’ Button for Your Work

Source/sauce: Banger Tweet (full version)

> This is so stupid I shouldn’t even be tweeting it. <br /> <br />
> In my role I context switch so many times during the week that a simple task can take days to weeks to get done. It also means I need to ramp back up on what I’ve done so far all over again. <br /> <br />
> To combat this I start a doc and I document what I’ve done so far in realtime. Example: I went to the UI and here’s a screenshot of what options I picked, here’s a link to the feature flag I changed, here are the Kafka messages that were generated, here is the link to the logs, here’s a slack link to the question I asked the integration team. <br /> <br />
> Inevitably when my manager decides something needs to happen sooner, or I ask if someone wants to take my task, or I just come back to it days later… boom here’s a doc outlining exactly where I am. I just read through the doc and it takes less time than redoing everything all over again. <br /> <br />
> I have 4-5 of these docs during the week because I don’t work on just one thing at a time.

## Action Steps aka “How to”

- Whenever you start working on a task, if you haven’t worked on this earlier, start a new document.
- Tools: Google Docs / Microsoft Word / <insert your company’s obscure tool>
  - If you have worked on this earlier, open the existing document.
- Start writing what you’ve done so far in realtime.
  - Add a date & time info somewhere so that you can identify when you did this thing.
- When you have to context switch to another task & get back to this, use the document to “Continue Game” your way into seamless productivity.
- Progress
- Win
- Awards
- Recognition
- Validation
- Promotion
- You’re now the CTO
- Enjoy
