# The Painful Reality (Problem)

![Why You So Quiet? Meme from Know Your Meme](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/045/225/why_u_so_quiet.jpg)

I asked ChatGPT to "write a professional email" and got something that sounded like a Shakespearean email in 2025/26.

Sounds like that manager who says "Just make it pop" or "I'll know it when I see it."

Unfortunately, _I_ was the bad manager to the AI.

![You Either Die A Hero, Or You Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become The Villain](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/019/634/die_a_hero.png)

The AI isn't stupid. **My prompts were just... lazy.**

# The Realization: Context is King (and Queen)

Let's take the analogy of ordering food.

You don't say "Bring me food." (You'll get raisins, possibly).

You say "Bring me spicy biryani, extra raita, no elaichi, delivered to [Location]."

Why do we struggle? Because thinking is hard. Especially with a blank chat.

# The Solution: The "5 Questions" Framework (The Tool)

## What do you want?

"Write an email" is useless.

"Write a polite follow-up email to a US client who ghosted our invoice for 45 days" is money.

## What context matters?

The AI isn't psychic. Give it the backstory.

You're not in Philly, you're in Bangalore. Time zones matter. Tone matters. Tell the AI.

## What should it NOT do?

Guardrails. Because AI will go off a cliff if you let it.

No "Dear Sir/Madam." No "Please do the needful." No 500-word essays for a 2-line ask.

## Who's reading this?

Your Dutch manager? Your Chennai QA lead? Your onsite coordinator in Philadelphia? Different people, different vibes.

## How do you want it?

Bullets for standups. Paragraphs for emails. Tables for reports. Pick.

# The "Power User" Section (Optional But Powerful)

## Give it a role

"Act as a senior consultant explaining to a skeptical client"

## Set the tone

"Professional but not stiff. Think TCS comms, not WITCH vibes."

## Tell it to reason

Force it to think step-by-step before it answers

## Add a self-check

Make the AI review its own work

## Blacklist topics

Things you never want it to mention like: "Never mention 'synergy,' 'leverage,' or 'circle back'"

# I am lazy to remember all of this...

So I built a tool. It's called PromptBuilder. [You can try it out here](https://prompt-builder-ten-xi.vercel.app/?utm_source=hastons.vercel.app).

It forces me to answer these 5 things.

Suddenly, the AI isn't stupid anymore.

# And the best parts are...

It has no login.

It saves nothing.

It costs ₹0.

Enjoy.
