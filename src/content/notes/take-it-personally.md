Yes, the title is clear nod to [Michael Jordan's "And I Took That Personally" meme from Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/michael-jordans-and-i-took-that-personally).

When it comes to self improvement, the not-so-obvious part is the self in self-improvement.

Let's take the case of Reading Books (mostly but not limited to non-fiction books).

The common outlook is it's either an activity or it's an identity. Recommendations include reading ~10 pages a day, roughly translating to ~300 pages per month and ~14.4 books a year (~250 being the average page count of a book).

Seems reasonable and doable.

Yet when it comes to execution, it is usually not the case. At least in my own experience.

## Reflections

In my reflections as well as through therapy, I came to terms that: my self image and self esteem both were tied to the results of the action of reading: feeling accomplished, feeling better than someone else, feeling more knowledgeable than someone else, etc.

Whenever I didn't take the required action (which I wanted to), my self image took massive hits for days and the negative cycle took a long time to recover from. This reflected in lots of areas.

## System Setup

This year, I decided that I will re-read and absorb and apply the concepts in Atomic Habits: decide an identity (whom I wanted to become and be) and vote for it through my actions and habits.

My reading style many times depend on my dopamine levels and my emotions.

In this system, I became comfortable with marking important aspects in the book with the help of a pen and colourful post it tags.

## Measure, then Improve

To improve my reading habit, I needed to:

- Start showing up
- Read 10 pages
- Mark it done in an excel sheet or an A4 paper
- Maintain & improve consistency
- Not focusing on perfection
- Personalize it even more

I started stacking my wins and nurturing my belief that I'm a Reader focused on improving myself to be better than who I was yesterday & the past, not to be better than someone.

Then I took a call not to be dogmatic & perfect about it.

Executing a habit consistently and tracking the habit both are exhausting because I'm now tracking 2 habits in place of 1. With ADHD it's harder.

I read depending on my dopamine levels, what I want to derive from the book, and my emotions. So some days are a lot and some days are few.
