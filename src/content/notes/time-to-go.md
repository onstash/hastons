In the past decade+, I have gone through multiple (overlapping) ~5 year stretches. One of them was **crisp (formerly Tenreads)** the startup I worked with right after my UG from SASTRA University. The people and the experience molded me as a person.

The other one close to my heart (literally) was this long distance relationship. And last month, we called it quits. This experience also shaped me in ways I can't explain easily.

Post that, I took a break from office in the first 14 days of December & attended a bunch of weddings some of whom are very close friends. Upon reflecting & speaking to my mentors, my parents, and also my friends - **I don't see any point in wallowing at this point. It's like listening to a single line of a song, on repeat (not the whole song).**

And that brought me to Phil Jackson's infamous words after the Chicago Bulls' 2nd 3-peat in 1998 (from the Last Dance) - **Time to Go**.

> Do you see the way that tree bends?

> Does it inspire?

> Leaning out to catch the sun's rays...

> a lesson to be applied...

> Are you gettin' something out of this all encompassing trip?

> You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets oh...

> Or you can come to terms and realize

> You're the only one who can forgive yourself oh yeah...

> Makes much more sense to live in the present tense...

Grateful for what happened. **Time to Go**.
