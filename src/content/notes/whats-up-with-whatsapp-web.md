I woke up to this [blog post](https://blog.whatsapp.com/614/WhatsApp-Web) about [WhatsApp](http://www.whatsapp.com) having a **_web client_** codenamed **WhatsApp Web**. I came across some weird points.

> **Our web client is simply an extension of your phone**: the web browser mirrors conversations and messages from your mobile device — this means all of your messages still live on your phone.

Extension of my phone? My foot. They should have named it **_WhatsCast_** or something.

> To connect your web browser to your WhatsApp client, simply open [https://web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com/) in your **Google Chrome** browser.

I understand that **_Google Chrome_** has a _fairly large user base_, although I don’t have the necessary data to support it, but why restrict your _web client_ to just one browser? I didn’t understand why.

> You will see a QR code —- scan the code inside of WhatsApp, and you’re ready to go. You have now paired WhatsApp on your phone with the WhatsApp web client. **Your phone needs to stay connected to the internet for our web client to work,** and please make sure to install the latest version of WhatsApp on your phone**.**

This weird blog post is after the [_highly popular_](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2475479,00.asp) blocking of users who got back to **WhatsApp** from **WhatsappPlus/WhatsApp+**.

For the uninitiated, [Telegram](http://www.telegram.org)’s CEO **Pavel Durov** had predicted this move from **WhatsApp** in his [blog post,](https://medium.com/@durov/how-to-predict-whatsapp-features-4c7d84d6c524) dated _November 19, 2014_.

> I’ll have a look at Telegram and tell you guys what features WhatsApp users will enjoy within a year or so:
>
> Ability to share documents of any type. They are unlikely to support 1Gb-large files like Telegram, but you can definitely count on 50–100Mb.
>
> A Web version at **web.whatsapp.com** like **web.telegram.org**. This is certain, since Jan emailed the developer of Telegram for Web, unsuccessfully trying to hire him for this purpose (I guess it was surprising for Jan to learn that some people actually do not sell out, not just say so).
>
> Distribution between multiple data-centers around the world. Combined with synchronization, this can take a while to set up. Still, if WhatsApp seriously wants to catch up, they need to do it to improve delivery time.
>
> A self-destruct timer for messages. With end-to-end encryption almost there, WhatsApp is ready to implement it in a smarter way.

> A great thing about building [Telegram](http://twitter.com/telegram) is that you can force bigger apps to improve their products. And also predict their actions.

So does this mean that people will migrate to Telegram? This where the concept of [_network effect_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) comes in.

> In economics and business, a **network effect (**also called **network externality** or **demand-side economies of scale)** is the effect that one user of a service has on the value of that product to other people. When a network effect is present, the value of a product or service is dependent on the number of others using it. Over time, positive network effects can create **a bandwagon effect** as the network becomes more valuable and more people join, in a positive feedback loop.

I hope WhatsApp understands the web!

### Live Long and Prosper _&_ May the Force be with you!
