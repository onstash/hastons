## Little Bit of Context

I am regular lurker at Twitter & recently at Bluesky as well. For the dopamemes.

Whenever I come across good-to-great tweets, posts, and blogposts on various topics, I get inspired & sense that I need a way to just dump my thoughts & host it on a site.

## My Failed Attempts

As a software enthusiast, over the years I have tried to write my "blog" in my failed attempts over the last decade:

- Medium
- Gatsby
- Next from Zeit (before it became Vercel)
- Next from Vercel
- Dev.to
- GitHub pages
- Ghost.org
- Jekyll (using rubylang)
- Vanilla HTML pages
- Substack

## My Observations About the Tools

I found that these tools required me to have a laptop with me, write in my IDE, push to a git repository or deploy from local.

Which is super annoying.

Not sure why this is the case in 2024, 2025 where we use our phones more than our laptops.

## My Observations About Myself

I didn't have a habit of writing regularly, earlier. Now I use Obsidian & I journal my thoughts in my trusty notebook, quite regularly.

I also realised that I "performing" only for the audience and seeking external validation (not just limited to my blogging attempts). Whenever I launched my blog, I share it with friends whom I expected to validate my feelings & support me.

But why would they, just because I am their friend? I have come to terms that it's a bonus if they do.

And not to be critical to myself, but arriving at this point took years of therapy & self-reflection.

Plus my undiagnosed ADHD didn't help.

## A New & Successful Attempt

So I decided to adopt WordPress once more (months after the A-Team drama\*). Hoping their mobile website for editing & publishing is as good as their desktop one.

Wishing myself more love and all the best 😀
